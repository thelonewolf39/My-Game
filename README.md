# 🕹️ MyGame (Alpha 0.1)

Welcome to the **Alpha 0.1** release of *MyGame*! 🎉  
This is an early test build, so expect missing features, bugs, and unfinished content.

## ℹ️ About the Game
*MyGame* is a **sandbox survival RPG hybrid**. You can choose how you want to play:  
- **Sandbox Survival**: Gather resources, build, and survive against the world.  
- **RPG Adventure**: Take on quests, fight enemies, and progress through skill trees.  

The goal is to give players **freedom** — you can focus on creativity, adventure, or a mix of both.
