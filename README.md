# 🕹️ Thryndor (Alpha 0.0.1)

Welcome to the **Alpha 0.0.1** release of *Thryndor*! 🎉  
This is an early test build, so expect missing features, bugs, and unfinished content.

## ℹ️ About the Game
*Thryndor* is a **sandbox survival RPG hybrid**. You can choose how you want to play:  
- **Sandbox Survival**: Gather resources, build, and survive against the world.  
- **RPG Adventure**: Take on quests, fight enemies, and progress through skill trees.  

The goal is to give players **freedom** — you can focus on creativity, adventure, or a mix of both.

## 📱 iOS / Apple Devices

Currently, **iOS is not supported** for open downloads.  
Apple’s system does not allow raw game files to be installed on standard iPhones or iPads outside of their official platforms.  

### How to Play for Now
- **Android**: Download the APK and install on your device.  
- **Linux / PC**: Download the appropriate build from the Releases section.  

> ⚠️ iOS support may come in the future once there’s an official App Store release, but there is **no way to play on iOS directly right now**.

## 💙 Our Promise to Players

*Thryndor* will always remain free to play. There will never be microtransactions, pay-to-win systems, or manipulative monetization.  
We want players to enjoy the game without feeling exploited.  
Any future updates or versions will honor this principle.

---

## Modding Policy
The current version of the game is closed-source.  
Every version that becomes 3 releases old will be published as open-source for anyone to study, modify, or fork.  

- Latest 3 versions: Closed-source, supported.  
- Versions older than that: Open-source, unsupported.  

This way, you can mod older versions freely, while the newest releases keep moving forward.
