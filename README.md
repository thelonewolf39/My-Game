## üíô Our Promise to Players

*Thryndor* will always remain free to play. There will never be microtransactions, pay-to-win systems, or manipulative monetization.  
We want players to enjoy the game without feeling exploited.  
Any future updates or versions will honor this principle.

## Modding Policy
The current version of the game is closed-source as of right now.  
Eventually, I'll make a modding website so you can all mod my game.
